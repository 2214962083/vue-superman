Thanks for being interested in contributing to this project!

## Development

### Setup

This project depends on node v14+ and pnpm 6.x

If you don't have pnpm installed, you should execute:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm@6.32.17
```

Clone this repo to your local machine and install the dependencies.

```bash
pnpm bootstrap
```

We use VuePress for rapid development and documenting. You can start it locally by

```bash
cd packages/doc-site
pnpm dev
```

## Contributing

## Code Style

Don't worry about the code style as long as you install the dev dependencies. Git hooks will format and fix them for you on committing.

## Thanks

Thank you again for being interested in this project! You are awesome!

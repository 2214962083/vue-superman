## What does Vue Superman do?

Vue Superman is not a specific npm package, it is a collection of libraries that I extracted from the reusable part of my work.

Although it's called Vue Superman, the library provided is not limited to Vue. I hope the libraries or utils in it can solve some of your development difficulties and make your development more comfortable.

You can view [Existing Libraries](/guide/#libs-list)

Mainly because of the busy work, too many warehouses will affect my enthusiasm for maintenance, so they are gathered together to facilitate unified maintenance. If the volume increases, I would consider splitting them into multiple repos.

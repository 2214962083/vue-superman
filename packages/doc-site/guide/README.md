# Introduction

Vue Superman is not a specific npm package, it is a collection of libraries that I extracted from the reusable part of my work.

Although it's called Vue Superman, the library provided is not limited to Vue. I hope the libraries or utils in it can solve some of your development difficulties and make your development more comfortable.

## Libs List

- [vue-xrender](/libs/vue-xrender/)

A library that allows you to render jsx in vue template or render template string in jsx, free rendering is up to you. Support vue2 and vue3.

- [class-mock](/libs/class-mock/)

A mock library that allows you use decorators with classes to generate fake data. Based on faker.js library.

- [vue-playground](/libs/vue-playground/)

- [vuepress-plugin-sandbox](/libs/vuepress-plugin-sandbox/)

It is a vuepress plugin based on vue-playground, which supports rapid writing of demos of real-time editing, real-time compilation, and real-time preview.

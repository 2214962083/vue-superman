# Introduction

Vue Superman is not a specific npm package, it is a collection of libraries that I extracted from the reusable part of my work.

Although it's called Vue Superman, the library provided is not limited to Vue. I hope the libraries or utils in it can solve some of your development difficulties and make your development more comfortable.

## Libs List

- [vue-xrender](/libs/vue-xrender/)

Render jsx in template or render template string in jsx, free rendering is up to you.

- [class-mock](/libs/class-mock/)

Use decorator to generate mock data, based on `@faker-js/faker` library, from now on you can replace interface with class, and you can generate mock data.
